# Battleship Project Summer 2023 SWEG Internship
We are apart of a 2023 SWEG Internship and this is one of the codes we want to show off. What we did was we were asked to code a program for the well know game of Battleship. So we are taking a simple game code and progressively getting harder during waves/stages to go more indepth complex for us to code but the user of the game will be able to do more and more.  

# How do I play?
 In order to play the game, you have to to first select your grid size and the sizes go from a 2x2 to whatever you want but for our code we recommend that a 10x10 would be the biggest you go, after you do that it prints 'Welcome to Battlehsip!'

After entering your grid size it is going to print the board with your selected grid size. Once doing that it is going to ask if you would like to manually enter your ship or not with a simple (yes/no)

If you entered 'YES' follow these instructions!!

YES - You will be asked to enter the number of ships you want first. you will be prompted to enter a name for your ship it is recommended that you do a one letter name for your ship. After this it is going to ask what length do you want your ship (1 or 2). Right before you get to the row/column indexes you have to input weather it will be a horizontal or vertical ship. Next you will enter the row you want your ship on and another prompt is going to ask what column you want your ship on. After doing these two steps it will load up the board and take you into the game. FOLLOW THE NO DIRECTIONS BELOW FROM HERE!!!

If entered 'NO' follow these instructions!!

NO - the computer will generate a spot for your ships and it will then proceed to take you into the game
When it takes you into the game all you will have to do from that point on is enter the row & column spot you want to hit in this format (x x) without the parethesis though. You will go back and forth with the computer until somebody wins and you are prompted and asked if you want to play again in a (yes/no) format.
